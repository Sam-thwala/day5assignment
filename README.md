   ---

   1. Language and Terminology:
      Tech Experts: You can use specialized jargon and industry-specific terms since your audience is familiar with the language of the field.
      Regular Folks: Simplify your language by avoiding technical jargon. Instead, explain terms in everyday language or provide clear definitions.

   2. Level of Detail:
      Tech Experts: They often appreciate comprehensive, in-depth explanations. Including technical nuances, detailed data, and references to methodologies can be beneficial.
      Regular Folks: Focus on the broader picture. Summarize the key points and explain how the technical details impact real-world scenarios without overwhelming them with minutiae.

   3. Visual Aids and Examples:
      Tech Experts: Use detailed graphs, code snippets, or schematics that provide the depth they expect.
      Regular Folks: Incorporate simple visuals, infographics, and analogies that make complex ideas more relatable and easier to grasp.

   4. Context and Relevance:
      Tech Experts: Frame your information within current industry trends, innovations, or technical challenges to underscore its relevance.
      Regular Folks: Connect the technical details to everyday impacts. For example, explain how a new technology might affect daily life or solve common problems.

   5. Engagement Techniques:
      Tech Experts: Encourage questions, debates, and deeper dives into specific topics. A detailed Q&A can help address their advanced queries.
      Regular Folks: Use storytelling and interactive examples to make the subject matter engaging and accessible. Breaking down complex topics into bite-sized, digestible pieces is effective.

   6. Purpose and Application:
      Tech Experts: Emphasize how the technical details can lead to innovations, efficiency gains, or improved systems. Focus on the underlying principles and practical applications within the field.
      Regular Folks: Highlight the benefits or changes that the technology brings to everyday experiences, ensuring that the practical implications are clear.
